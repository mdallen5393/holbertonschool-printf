.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm produces output according to a
.Ar format
string (see below) passed into the function.
Output is sent to stdout.
The
.Ar format
string controls the output of the function by specifying how each variable should be printed.
The function is variadic, allowing for any number of variables to be passed into it, so long as there are the same number of corresponding format specifiers.
.Pp
The format string consists of characters and format specifiers.
Format specifiers are used to take the place of variables of their corresponding type.
They are of the form "%[character]".
Each format specifier corresponds to a variable passed into the function, in order of appearance.
The following is a list of format specifiers that have been implemented into this program:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It %d, %i
Used to print signed integer data types.
.It %c
Used to print character data types.
.It %s
Used to print string data types.
.It %%
Used to print a literal percent (%) character.

.Sh RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return,
.Nm
returns the total number of characters printed.
Upon error, a negative value is returned.

This implementation of
.Nm
uses a buffer of size 1024 to store the string to be printed.
Care should be taken to not overflow the buffer.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It To print a time:

_printf("The time is %d:%d %s.\n");

Output: The time is 2:43 PM.

.It To print a name:

_printf("Hello, %s, my name is %s.\n");

Output: Hello Nick, my name is Matthew.
